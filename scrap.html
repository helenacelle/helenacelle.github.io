    	    <h4>Ecclesiastes 4:1</h4>
    	    <p>Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed - and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors - and they have no comforter.</p>
    	    <h4>Ecclesiastes 4:2</h4>
    	    <p>And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.</p>
    	    <h4>Ecclesiastes 4:3</h4>
    	    <p>But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</p>
